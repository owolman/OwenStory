There was a student named Timmy, he was a student at UW-Madison. He was enrolled in Calc 2, and had a midterm coming up. Timmy was not the best at math, and he had not studied at all for his midterm. He needed to find a way fast to get good at math.
The night before his exam he was awoken by a mystic figure, and this figure called himself The Math God of Wisdom. He told Timmy that if he wished to learn the material for exam he needed to scale the Mountain of Math to find the Math God and learn his ways.
