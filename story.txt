There was a student named Timmy, he was a student at UW-Madison. He was enrolled in Calc 2, and had a midterm coming up. Timmy was not the best at math, and he had not studied at all for his midterm. He needed to find a way fast to get good at math.
The night before his exam he was awoken by a mystic figure, and this figure called himself The Math God of Wisdom. He told Timmy that if he wished to learn the material for exam he needed to scale the Mountain of Math to find the Math God and learn his ways. 
Timmy packed his math books from those covering algebra to differential equations and calc 3 and decided to attempt to scale the Math mountain because it would be ten times easier than calc 2, which is impossible. Timmy was unaware at the time, but, when he finally reached the top of the mountain he found a two faced god. The math god was also the god of computer science. He promised to provide timmy with all the knowledge of calc 2 if Timmy promised to change his major to comp sci instead of math.
